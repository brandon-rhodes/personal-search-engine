Guido has consistently commented that PEP 8 checkers and reformatters are by
definition not PEP 8 compliant.  They all lack essential human judgment and

On essential and accidental complexity: nearly every prediction Brooks made
was wrong.

This was inevitable because the concepts, as defined by Brooks, are, if not
meaningless, pretty much impossible to reasonably use in practice.

9/ While CA‚Äôs surge is very real and tragic, our huge population makes things
look worse than they are, comparatively. On per-person basis, even w/ surge,
CA ranks 33rd among states in cases/100K (5,595; North Dakota is #1 at 12,051)
and 42nd in deaths/100K (62; NJ is #1 at 201).

So a lot of chatter happening on the slow vaccine roll out

Personally, I'm incredibly frustrated.

Did we not know that vaccines were coming? Is vaccine administration a
surprise?

Several complex issues so lets break things down a bit

    Dear @nytimes photo editor:

    Huge fan here. But when you post pic of a guy grimacing while getting his
    vaccine (when shot actually feels like a pin prick), at least consider
    fact that 1000s may see this as reason to not get vaccinated. Some will
    die from that decision. Thanks.

Tell me which "elite bubble" that might be? The one where scientists worked
tirelessly to create&ensure safety of vaccines in record time? Where
healthcare workers went without PPE? Where 300k+ Americans died?

Or: the bubble where you went to the front of the line for a vaccine?

Teaching is perhaps 100x harder than we expect. The common misconception is
that it‚Äôs about sharing your knowledge; it‚Äôs not. Rather, it‚Äôs about
understanding what‚Äôs in the student‚Äôs mind, modeling that in your mind,
building a bridge from the student‚Äôs mental state to yours.

10) here is earlier study on human to mink  to human transmission, which also
experienced a mutation in minks (diff mutation). This is why we need to
eradicate the virus completely not just keep it simmering on a low grade burn.
The pursuit of complete eradication is key.

the vaccine has been their most popular article on Facebook for two days
now....we really need to think about headlines and how much we play up a small
