On essential and accidental complexity: nearly every prediction Brooks made
was wrong.

This was inevitable because the concepts, as defined by Brooks, are, if not
meaningless, pretty much impossible to reasonably use in practice.

9/ While CA’s surge is very real and tragic, our huge population makes things
look worse than they are, comparatively. On per-person basis, even w/ surge,
CA ranks 33rd among states in cases/100K (5,595; North Dakota is #1 at 12,051)
and 42nd in deaths/100K (62; NJ is #1 at 201).

So a lot of chatter happening on the slow vaccine roll out

Personally, I'm incredibly frustrated.

Did we not know that vaccines were coming? Is vaccine administration a
surprise?

Several complex issues so lets break things down a bit

    Dear @nytimes photo editor:

    Huge fan here. But when you post pic of a guy grimacing while getting his
    vaccine (when shot actually feels like a pin prick), at least consider
    fact that 1000s may see this as reason to not get vaccinated. Some will
    die from that decision. Thanks.

works.

Points:
-precipitation *almost* always starts as ice (even in summer) ❄️
-freezing rain and sleet are a result of water that melted and REFROZE in the

Tell me which "elite bubble" that might be? The one where scientists worked
tirelessly to create&ensure safety of vaccines in record time? Where
healthcare workers went without PPE? Where 300k+ Americans died?

Or: the bubble where you went to the front of the line for a vaccine?

    It isn’t just him

    Many in elite bubbles believe the American public doesn’t know “what’s

Teaching is perhaps 100x harder than we expect. The common misconception is
that it’s about sharing your knowledge; it’s not. Rather, it’s about
understanding what’s in the student’s mind, modeling that in your mind,
building a bridge from the student’s mental state to yours.

10) here is earlier study on human to mink  to human transmission, which also
experienced a mutation in minks (diff mutation). This is why we need to
eradicate the virus completely not just keep it simmering on a low grade burn.
The pursuit of complete eradication is key.

    HUMAN➡️MINKS➡️HUMAN transmission on mink farms in NL. 68% of the tested

    coronavirus mutated & even evolved within minks before transmitted back to

the vaccine has been their most popular article on Facebook for two days
now....we really need to think about headlines and how much we play up a small
number of bad reactions or more ppl will die.
